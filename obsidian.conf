    sendto_one("NOTE PRIVACY :This service collects and processes personal data in accordance with our privacy policy.");
    sendto_one("NOTE PRIVACY :You can read the full policy at: https://example.com/privacy-policy");

    sendto_one("NOTE PRIVACY :If you do not agree with the terms, please disconnect from the service.");
    sendto_one("NOTE PRIVACY :To accept the privacy policy, click Accept");


so if the user has teh capability the client can render a modal dialog with the privacy policy and an "Accept" button.
if the user does not have the capability, the client can show a notice with a link to the privacy policy and an "Accept" button
if the user clicks "Accept", the client sends a command to the server to accept the privacy policy
and the server can then store the user's consent in the database.
The server can also check if the user has already accepted the privacy policy and skip sending the notice if they have.
